Adam Wright's SaltStack Formulas
================================

Each top-level directory in this repository is a SaltStack formula that I use,
sometimes originating from the `official directory of SaltStack formulas`_.
Since they generally contains customisations, the easiest way to manage
them is by adding each one as git subtree to this repository.
